# The repo.
* This repo is the test demo of TCENet. We have provided sample data and the test case model.

# Usage.
* We offered some samples which are not included in the datasets we describe in the paper.
* You can set the T_id and test those samples with the corresponding model.
* After installing the required packages, use: `python3 TCENet.py` to run the test cases. 

# The complete dataset.
* We will publish our dataset after the official publication of the paper.

# Examples
* The examples folder provides a STIX 2.1 TTP intelligence example and a Sigma detection rule example. You can use the TTP intelligence JSON in this STIX 2.1 visualization website:https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-stix-visualization/.
