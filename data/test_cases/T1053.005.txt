The artifacts usually mimic the names of known executables. Persistence is typically maintained through Scheduled Tasks or via registry keys. Additionally, Emotet creates randomly-named files in the system root directories that are run as Windows services.
Use antivirus programs, with automatic updates of signatures and software, on clients and servers. Apply appropriate patches and updates immediately (after appropriate testing). Implement filters at the email gateway to filter out emails with known malspam indicators, such as known malicious subject lines, and block suspicious IP addresses at the firewall.
The b program, when run, deletes itself from the filesystem of the device, so it is only present in memory, Sophos explained. Then, it repeats a series of tasks every three to six hours. The first of these tasks is to connect to the IP address 43.229.55.44.
Check Point traced the stolen money to a bank account belonging a closed business in Hong Kong, researchers said. Attackers even managed to use this communication to cancel a meeting that was scheduled in Shanghai between the Chinese owner of the account where the transfer was headed and the CEO of the Israeli startup, researchers said. The hackers sent separate emails to each party that used different excuses for the cancellation, according to Check Point.
UNC2452 used scheduler and schtasks to create new tasks on remote hosts as part of lateral movement. They also manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returned the scheduled task to its original configuration. UNC2452 also created a scheduled task to maintain Sunspot persistence when the host booted.
$[para]. Scheduled tasks enable administrators to run tasks or “jobs” at designated times rather than every time the system is booted or the user logs in. This feature can be implemented via the Windows COM API, which the first versions of Ramsay have tailored.
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments).
Travelex said in this case it was experts who advised the company pay those responsible for the New Year’s Eve attack, which forced the company to shut down its online services and its mobile app. The attack left retail locations to carry out tasks manually and many customers stranded without travel money, while global banking partners also were left adrift with no way to buy or sell foreign currency.

However, we observed that some miners have developed sneaky ways of making drive-by mining persistent, thanks to the use of pop-unders, a practice well-known in the ad fraud business. To add insult to injury, the malicious pop-under tab containing the mining code would get placed right underneath the taskbar, rendering it virtually invisible to the end user. Thanks to this trick, the mining can carry on until the user actually restarts their computer.
$[para]. To achieve persistence, KryptoCibule creates a scheduled task to be run every five minutes with the following command. Once again, it uses an Adobe Reader-related name.
$[para]. A second JavaScript command was also executed, which created a scheduled task to execute chfeeds.vbe multiple times a day. $[para].
Finally, it created a scheduled task, set to execute a remote XSL script periodically via the copied WMIC.exe. cmd.exe used to create a scheduled task to interpret a malicious XSL script via WMIC. $[para].
Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). $[para].
Click to register. The flaw stems from the Netlogon Remote Protocol, available on Windows domain controllers, which is used for various tasks related to user and machine authentication. Specifically, the issue exists in the usage of AES-CFB8 encryption for Netlogon sessions.
The key mentioned in that article is used to determine the behavior of Edge when restarting after a crash. Terminating Edge via the Task Manager is also treated as a crash, and that is the only way the trapped user can close that hijacked tab anyway. The key that is discussed in the article is this one.
It is a banking Trojan built to steal financial data such as credentials and credit/debit card numbers, but not limited to this functionality. The propagation of this threat began during the 2018 Brazilian elections, registering over 10,000 installations to April 2019 from the official Google Play Store alone. This malware can perform tasks such as keystroke logging, screen recording, SMS interception, and the theft of credit card and financial information.
This “miraculous” application promises to protect the victim’s device against viruses, to optimize memory space, and to save data when using a 3G or 4G connection. In reality it is a banking Trojan. The malicious CleanDroid application shown in a Facebook advertisement.
A considerable number of Brazilian financial institutions and other popular websites such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix are on the target list. However, when it comes to stealing banking credentials, metadata such as the device name, IMEI, and the telephone number used by the victim are sent to a remote C2. Why pay special attention to this data.
However, when it comes to stealing banking credentials, metadata such as the device name, IMEI, and the telephone number used by the victim are sent to a remote C2. Why pay special attention to this data? Well, fraudsters need it to mimic legitimate access to the account of the victim.
$[para]. Scheduling a task on a remote system typically requires being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system. $[para].
